            <p>This project involves improving performance of existing air traffic flow management systems and to develop 
                future trajectory-based ATFM. An initial study was conducted for evaluating various operational performance 
                of the existing Air Traffic Flow Management System’s Traffic Management Initiatives 
                (Ground Delay Program /Ground Stop).
            <p>
                This study aims to understand the gap in existing ATFM systems to optimize ATFM performance further and identify
                 best practices for the benefit of the overall air transport system. The study also evaluated key technical and 
                 data requirements to develop next-generation 4-D trajectory Based operation as ICAO ASBU up-gradation. 
                 The project also evaluate how effectively machine learning and artificial intelligence and improve ATFM 
                 performance. Python tool was used for data pre-processing , data analysis and machine learning . A database 
                 was designed in MySQL for storing the raw data collected from all airports. Queries were used to get the 
                 desired calculated data as output from the MySQL back end. The python data analysis results were exported to 
                 MS Excel and Tableau for report generation as graphs and tables.

            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>This project involved data analysis on early departures to capacity constrained airports that is having 
                impact on average delay of arrivals. The domestic air traffic movement has increased tremendously over the 
                last few years, thereby, causing congestion and capacity constraints at the airports in metro cities. 
                Early departures from domestic airports to these capacity constrained airports being the primary reason 
                for this congestion, was studied and analysed. Data from 62 airports was collected centrally and grouped 
                at Central Air Traffic Flow Management, along with DGCA standard block timing data. A MS Excel template 
                was designed that involved macros & formulas for validation and grouping. A database was designed in MS 
                Access for storing the raw data collected from all airports. Queries were used to get the desired 
                calculated data as output from the MS Access back end. The MS Access results were exported to MS Excel 
                and analysed to obtain the results as graphs and tables.

            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>Anaconda Python/R Data Science Platform</p>
            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>This project implements prediction of schedule variation and aircraft landing time based on Multi Linear 
                    Regression models with minimal attributes using machine learning from historical data of previous flight
                    operations. Air traffic congestion and air delay are two significant issues faced by the capacity 
                    constrained airports. Growth of scheduled flights and increased number of passengers per year will
                    lead to an increase in air traffic congestion. If proper monitoring and controlling measures are not
                    taken for schedule variation (delay/early) of arrival, the congestion will get worse in the near future.
                    Flight schedule variation is due to certain factors such as inbound flight delay, weather condition, 
                    turn-around delay and unpredictable flight maintenance. This project involved tracking of critical 
                    operational factors which influence scheduled variations and modelling of a predictive algorithm to forecast 
                    scheduled arrival variations due to the effect of different phases of flight. The variables that influence 
                    arrival time variation (early, on time and delay) were found and used to predict the arrival time using 
                    machine learning. The flight delay prediction was treated as a regression problem in which the delay was 
                    predicted using independent variables.

            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>This project implements an adaptive algorithm for filtering and fusion of multiple heterogeneous sensors, 
                which includes secondary surveillance radars at different geographical location and Automatic Dependent 
                Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), whose measurements and sensor characteristics are different from one 
                another. Decentralized fusion architecture based on 4D-dimensional (3-D plus time) Earth-Centered 
                Earth-Fixed (ECEF) common coordinate system was adapted to process the data received asynchronously 
                from multiple heterogeneous sensors. The implemented algorithm, removes sensor bias, by proper sensor 
                registration process using LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm and thereby increasing the quality of the 
                track. A decentralized Adaptive filter with Decentralized Kalman Filter Fusion (ADKFF) method based on 
                Mahalanobis distance carries out the fusion task. This project also makes use of the Down-linked Aircraft 
                Parameters (DAP) which can be obtained from mode-S radar and ADS-B for the computation-ally efficient 
                fusion process. The results indicate that the proposed adaptive filtering algorithm with decentralized 
                Kalman filtering can remove sensor registration error, better tracking performance, eliminating ghost and 
                more accurate position information using different types of surveillance sensors.

        <h1>Performance Improvement of Air Traffic Flow Management and 4D-Trajectory Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>
      
        <p>In this thesis, I studied areas of performance improvement in Air Traffic Flow Management and 4D Trajectory 
            Prediction and developed several data-driven models for (i) Estimated Arrival Time Prediction (ii) 
            Estimated Departure Time Prediction (iii) Optimisation Ground Delay Program and (iv) Aircraft Trajectory 
            Prediction and Strategic Trajectory Conflict Detection. This research analysed actual traffic scenarios in 
            Indian Airspace, various traffic patterns and scheduled flight characteristics before proposing numerous 
            data-driven models to satisfy present and future ATFM planning requirements for optimal capacity, 
            efficiency, predictability and safety.

        <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>The research addressed the Arrival time prediction problem for scheduled flights. Unlike other systems that gather and use all available features, we efficiently employed feature engineering to determine the effectiveness of derived features in Arrival Time prediction. The capabilities of the Exponential Moving Average in tracking temporal variation in flying time were effectively exploited for arrival time prediction.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>A machine learning based model for In Block Time prediction and arrival scheduled variation ( Early/On Time /Delay) classification has been proposed.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>A novel time-based computation method for estimating landing time based on aircraft trajectory characteristics has been developed. A model has been developed based on this for landing time prediction which relies on random variation in the flying time of scheduled flights. This has been implemented using M5P and RF machine learning approaches.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>A machine learning-based method for predicting the departure time of scheduled aircraft has been developed. The model, which is based on M5P and MLP algorithms, can identify departure delays and forecast departure status (Early/On Time/Delay) depending on the preceding leg departure time.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>Utilising the improved landing and departure times, a novel algorithm for optimising the Ground Delay Program using Mixed Integer Linear Programming has been developed</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>A Bi-LSTM model has been created for predicting 4-D trajectory and enhancing ETA prediction. The model is capable to predict Short term and Long term 4D trajectories.</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-plane fa-lg"></i>For future trajectory-based ATFM planning, a model for representing 4D trajectory and its protected airspace on a hexagonal grid has been proposed. Based on this, a novel model for strategic conflict detection based on hexagonal grind indexing has been developed.</li>
